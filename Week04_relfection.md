Week 4 focuses on finding words such as the longest, shortest, odd words, the average word, and intersecting words. This week was more difficult for me personally. One area I need to work on is writing cleaner and more efficient code. While looking at the professor’s code, I noticed that it is much more concise and organized than mine. Furthermore, the professor’s code is more brief and to the point, which makes it easier to understand. Something that stood out was the use of doctrings to further explain what the code does. In my code I used comments but the docstrings can provide additional help with being more descriptive. Additionally, my code was more redundant whereas the professor’s version used clearer and simpler structures to achieve the same results. I also realized that I need to improve how I handle specific scenarios, such as empty lists, to make my code more effective. Overall, comparing my work with the professor’s showed me the importance of writing clean and efficient. Less can be more and this assignment has highlighted how I need to work on how to make something easier for myself, rather than more difficult. I need to make my work more clear and understanable.
